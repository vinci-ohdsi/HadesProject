## Declaring Python Requirements with `py_require()`

`py_require()` is the recommended way to declare Python dependencies. A
`py_require()` call is similar to a `library()` call for Python packages.

`py_require()`:

-   Should appear near the beginning of an R script.
-   Declares the Python dependencies needed for the script.
-   Applies only to the current R session.
-   Has no effect if called multiple times with the same arguments.

R packages can also call `py_require()` when loaded, and their declared
dependencies are combined with those declared by the user and other loaded R
packages.

Calling `py_require("pkg")` updates the Python requirements manifest that
reticulate maintains for the current R session. This manifest is used only if no
manually managed Python environment is found earlier in the Python [Order of
Discovery](../versions#order-of-discovery). The manifest is not consulted and
requirements are not resolved until reticulate needs to initialize Python,
typically at the first `import()` call. Requirements are resolved into a cached
ephemeral environment specific to the unique set of dependencies declared.

While not required, it is generally recommended to declare all Python
dependencies before reticulate initializes Python. The simplest approach is to
place all `py_require()` calls at the start of the script, alongside `library()`
calls.

Usage example:

``` r
library(reticulate)
py_require("jax")    # Declare jax is a requirement

jax <- import("jax") # <-- initialize Python with declared requirements
```

### Unsatisfiable requirements.

It's possible to inadvertently declare an unsatisfiable set of Python
requirements. This can happen for a variety of reasons, most often due to:

-   Incompatible requirements declared by different R packages.
-   A recently published Python package version that introduces conflicts.

To troubleshoot:

1.  Figure out what the conflicting requirements are and where they are coming
    from.
2.  Update the requirements to resolve conflicts.

To help with step 1, calling `py_require()` with no arguments will print out a
manifest of the current requirements, as well as a table showing what
requirements were declared by different R packages.

Additionally, attempting to initialize Python will print out a detailed error
message.

For example:

``` r
library(reticulate)
py_require("numpy>2")
py_require("numpy<2")
import("numpy")
```

```
  × No solution found when resolving `--with` dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because you require numpy>2 and numpy<2, we can conclude that your
      requirements are unsatisfiable.
uv error code: 1
-- Current requirements -------------------------------------------------
 Python:   3.11.11 (reticulate default)
 Packages: numpy, numpy>2, numpy<2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error in uv_get_or_create_env() :
  Call `py_require()` to remove or replace conflicting requirements.
```

You can call `py_require()` again to update the requirements and make them
satisfiable. Options for resolving issues include:

1.  **Rolling Back to a Known Working State**

    If your requirements were previously satisfiable but recently broke, it is
    likely due to a newly published package version. You can roll back to a
    known working state by specifying a date with `exclude_newer`.

    ``` r
    # Roll back to a known working state.
    py_require(exclude_newer = "2025-01-19")
    ```

2.  **Removing Conflicting Requirements**

    If your requirements cannot be satisfied due to conflicts, you can use
    `action = "remove"` or `action = "set"` to update or remove specific
    packages.

    ``` r
    py_require("numpy<2", action = "remove")
    ```

    You can also retrieve and modify the full set of current requirements if
    needed. For example, given a larger set of conflicting tensorflow
    requirements:

    ``` r
    # Declare conflicting requirements.
    py_require(c("tensorflow==2.17.*",
                 "tensorflow<=2.16",
                 "tensorflow[and-cuda]",
                 "tensorflow-cpu",
                 "tensorflow<=2.18"))
    ```

    You can use `action = "remove"` to remove all TensorFlow-related
    requirements:

    ``` r
    # Remove all TensorFlow requirements.
    all_py_pkgs <- py_require()$packages
    tf_pkgs <- grep("tensorflow", all_py_pkgs, value = TRUE)
    py_require(tf_pkgs, action = "remove")
    ```

    Or you can use `action = "set"` to replace all declared requirements:

    ``` r
    # Replace all package requirements except TensorFlow.
    all_py_pkgs <- py_require()$packages
    all_py_pkgs_sans_tf <- grep("tensorflow", all_py_pkgs, value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
    py_require(all_py_pkgs_sans_tf, action = "set")
    ```

3.  **Installing a Development Version**

    If a development version of a package has fixed the issue but has not yet
    been published to PyPi, you can install it directly from GitHub or the local
    filesystem.

    ``` r
    # Install the 'markitdown' package from GitHub.
    py_require("markitdown@git+https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown.git@main#subdirectory=packages/markitdown")

    # Install it from the local filesystem.
    py_require("markitdown@/Users/tomasz/github/microsoft/markitdown/packages/markitdown/")
    ```

    See `py_require()` for more examples.

## Overview

Python packages are typically installed from one of two package repositories:

1)  [PyPI](https://pypi.org/); or

2)  [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/docs/)

Any Python package you install from PyPI or Conda can be used from R with
reticulate.

Each installation of Python on your system has its own set of packages. How
reticulate selects a Python installation, and how you can configure the
behavior, is described in the [version](versions.html) vignette.

### Python environments

When installing Python packages it's best practice to isolate them within a
Python environment (a named Python installation that exists for a specific
project or purpose). This provides a measure of isolation, so that updating a
Python package for one project doesn't impact other projects. The risk for
package incompatibilities is significantly higher with Python packages than it
is with R packages, because unlike CRAN, PyPI does not enforce, or even check,
if the current versions of packages currently available are compatible.

The reticulate package includes functions for creating Python environments
(either virtualenvs or conda envs) and installing packages within them. Both
virtual environments and conda environments are supported on all platforms
(Linux, macOS, and Windows).

Note that facilities to create and manage virtual environments (commonly
refereed to as a "venv") come with the Python standard library, and are the
recommended way to create isolated python installations. Conda environments are
supported as well, but be aware that there is the potential for binary
incompatibilities between packages built by conda and packages built outside of
conda (e.g., [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), or
[PPM](https://packagemanager.posit.co/)).

## Simple Installation

The reticulate package includes a `py_install()` function that can be used to
install one or more Python packages. The packages will be by default be
installed within a virtualenv or Conda environment named "r-reticulate". For
example:

``` r
library(reticulate)
py_install("pandas")
```

This provides a straightforward high-level interface to package installation and
helps encourage the use of a common default environment ("r-reticulate") across
the installation of distinct Python packages.

There are also functions available for directly managing both Conda and
virtualenvs for situations where you want more control over how packages are
installed. These functions are covered in the sections below.

## Virtualenv installation

The following functions are available for managing Python virtualenvs:

| Function               | Description                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `virtualenv_list()`    | List all available virtualenvs                     |
| `virtualenv_create()`  | Create a new virtualenv                            |
| `virtualenv_install()` | Install a package within a virtualenv              |
| `virtualenv_remove()`  | Remove individual packages or an entire virtualenv |

Virtual environments are by default located at `~/.virtualenvs`. You can change
this behavior by defining the `WORKON_HOME` environment variable.

Here's an example of using these functions to create an environment, install
packages within it, then use the environment from R:

``` r
library(reticulate)

# create a new environment
virtualenv_create("r-reticulate")

# install SciPy
virtualenv_install("r-reticulate", "scipy")

# import SciPy (it will be automatically discovered in "r-reticulate")
scipy <- import("scipy")
```

Note that you may have a given Python package installed in multiple
environments, in that case you may want to call the `use_virtualenv()` function
to ensure that a specific virtualenv is utilized by reticulate:

``` r
library(reticulate)

# indicate that we want to use a specific virtualenv
use_virtualenv("r-reticulate")

# import SciPy (will use "r-reticulate" as per call to use_virtualenv)
scipy <- import("scipy")
```

Virtual environments are typically derived from (created using) a "starter"
python installation. That is, there must be a python installation already
installed on the system before you can create virtual environments. You can
install a "venv starter" python in a variety of ways, however is most
convenient:

-   On macOS and Windows, visit <https://www.python.org/downloads/> and install
    a suitable version for your system.
-   On Linux, you can use prebuilt python binaries from
    <https://github.com/rstudio/python-builds>
-   On all platforms, you can use `reticulate::install_python()`. Note that on
    macOS and Linux, this will build Python from source on your system, which
    may take up to a few minutes.

There can be multiple versions of Python installed along-side each other on a
system (for example, Python versions 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11). By default,
reticulate will use the latest version installed on the system for creating the
virtualenv. If you have specific version constraints on the version of Python
required, you can supply those to the `version` argument--for example:
`virtualenv_create(version = ">=3.9")`

At anytime, you can see all the available virtualenv starters on your system by
calling `virtualenv_starter(all = TRUE)`. If you have Python venv starters
installed in non-standard locations, you can inform reticulate where to look by
setting the environment variable `RETICULATE_VIRTUALENV_STARTER`.

## Conda installation

The following functions are available for managing Conda environments:

| Function          | Description                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `conda_list()`    | List all available conda environments                     |
| `conda_create()`  | Create a new conda environment                            |
| `conda_install()` | Install a package within a conda environment              |
| `conda_remove()`  | Remove individual packages or an entire conda environment |

Here's an example of using these functions to create an environment, install
packages within it, then use the environment from R:

``` r
library(reticulate)

# create a new environment
conda_create("r-reticulate")

# install SciPy
conda_install("r-reticulate", "scipy")

# import SciPy (it will be automatically discovered in "r-reticulate")
scipy <- import("scipy")
```

Note that you may have a given Python package installed in multiple Conda
environments, in that case you may want to call the `use_condaenv()` function to
ensure that a specific Conda environment is utilized by reticulate:

``` r
library(reticulate)

# indicate that we want to use a specific condaenv
use_condaenv("r-reticulate")

# import SciPy (will use "r-reticulate" as per call to use_condaenv)
scipy <- import("scipy")
```

## Shell installation

You can also use standard shell installation utilities (`pip` or `conda`) to
install Python packages:

``` bash
# install into system level Python
$ sudo pip install SciPy

# install into active Conda environment
$ conda install SciPy
```

When doing this, be sure to make note of which version of Python your package
has been installed within, and call `use_python()` functions as appropriate to
ensure that this version is used by reticulate.

Alternatively, within `repl_python()`, you can prefix `!` to send a shell
command, and the version of `pip` or `conda` used will already be configured for
the Python installation reticulate is currently using.

``` shell
!pip install scipy
```
