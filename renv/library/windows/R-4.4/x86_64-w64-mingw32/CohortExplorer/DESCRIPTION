Description: This software tool is designed to extract data from a randomized subset of individuals 
    within a cohort and make it available for exploration in a shiny application environment. It 
    retrieves date-stamped, event-level records from one or more data sources that represent patient 
    data in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model format. This tool 
    features a user-friendly interface that enables users to efficiently explore the extracted 
    profiles, thereby facilitating applications, such as reviewing structured profiles.
